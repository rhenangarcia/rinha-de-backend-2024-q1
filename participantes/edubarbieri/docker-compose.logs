db-1     | Installation of system tables failed!  Examine the logs in
db-1     | /var/lib/mysql/ for more information.
db-1     | 
db-1     | The problem could be conflicting information in an external
db-1     | my.cnf files. You can ignore these by doing:
db-1     | 
db-1     |     shell> /usr/bin/mariadb-install-db --defaults-file=~/.my.cnf
db-1     | 
db-1     | You can also try to start the mariadbd daemon with:
db-1     | 
db-1     |     shell> /usr/sbin/mariadbd --skip-grant-tables --general-log &
db-1     | 
db-1     | and use the command line tool /usr/bin/mariadb
db-1     | to connect to the mysql database and look at the grant tables:
db-1     | 
db-1     |     shell> /usr/bin/mariadb -u root mysql
db-1     |     MariaDB> show tables;
db-1     | 
db-1     | Try '/usr/sbin/mariadbd --help' if you have problems with paths.  Using
db-1     | --general-log gives you a log in /var/lib/mysql/ that may be helpful.
